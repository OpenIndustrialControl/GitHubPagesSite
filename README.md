# Open Industrial Control

A group for developing free and open systems for use in industrial automation.

## Industrial IO System

The current focus of the group is a modular, configurable IO system for use with OpenPLC and other master controllers.
This group has sprung from a [lively discussion on the OpenPLC forums](https://discord.com/channels/1390406671884353717/1390410667579932717/1390413088309645322).
